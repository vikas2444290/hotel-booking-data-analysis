# Hotel Booking Cancellation Analysis 📊

## Project Overview
This project analyzes hotel booking data to understand the key factors driving reservation cancellations and their impact on hotel revenue. Using exploratory data analysis (EDA), the project aims to generate actionable business insights that can help hotels reduce cancellations and improve revenue efficiency.

---

## Business Problem
City Hotels and Resort Hotels have been experiencing high booking cancellation rates, resulting in revenue loss and underutilized rooms.  
The objective of this analysis is to identify patterns behind cancellations by examining pricing, seasonality, hotel type, booking channels, and customer behavior, and to propose data-driven recommendations.

## Dataset
- **Source:** Hotel booking dataset (2015–2017)
- **Key Features:**
  - Booking status (cancelled / not cancelled)
  - Hotel type (City / Resort)
  - Average Daily Rate (ADR)
  - Country of origin
  - Distribution channels (Online TA, Offline TA, Groups, Direct)
  - Monthly and seasonal booking patterns

---

## Analysis Approach
The analysis was performed using Python in a Jupyter Notebook and followed a structured EDA workflow:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Cancellation vs non-cancellation comparison
- City Hotel vs Resort Hotel analysis
- Monthly and seasonal reservation trends
- Impact of pricing (ADR) on cancellation behavior
- Country-wise cancellation distribution
- Booking channel analysis (Online, Group, Direct)

---

## Key Insights
- Approximately **37% of total bookings were cancelled**, significantly affecting revenue
- **Higher Average Daily Rate (ADR)** strongly correlates with higher cancellation rates
- **Resort hotels** show a higher cancellation ratio compared to city hotels
- **January** records the highest cancellations, while **August** has the highest booking volume
- Around **46% of bookings come from online travel agencies**, contributing most to cancellations
- **Portugal** has the highest number of cancelled reservations

## Business Recommendations
Based on the analysis, the following actions are suggested:

- Optimize pricing strategies during high-cancellation periods
- Offer targeted discounts for resort hotels on weekends and holidays
- Launch focused marketing campaigns during high-risk months like January
- Improve service quality in regions with high cancellation rates to reduce customer churn
